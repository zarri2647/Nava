I just use ai to fix the grammar and the step by step, i know that my grammar is super mess so yeah i hope you all finish this step by step üôèüèª if you having a big trouble regarding this document you can watch the tutorial video of how to set termux rnvc and also the desktop.

Let's gets started
This guide will help you set up Termux and RealVNC Viewer on your Android device to execute Java code with AWT/Swing. Please follow each step carefully.
Step-by-Step Guide
  1. Download and Install Termux:
   Click this link to download the Termux APK: https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_1022.apk
   After installation, open Termux and enter the following commands to update and upgrade packages:
```
pkg upgrade && pkg update
```

  2. Download nava.sh:
   Download the nava.sh package automation script. (Which is shown on the repository)
  3. Download and Install RealVNC Viewer:
   Click this link to download RealVNC Viewer from the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.realvnc.viewer.android
   After installation, open Termux, long-press the screen, and paste the following command. Accept the permission prompt to grant Termux access to your phone storage. This creates a symbolic link to your storage.
```
termux-setup-storage
```
  4. Create a Folder for Your Code:
   Open your file manager (e.g., Google Files or ZArchiver).
   Navigate to your "Documents" folder and create a new folder named my_java_code.
  Navigate to Downloads in Termux:
   Open Termux, paste the following code, and press Enter:
```
cd ~/storage/downloads
```
  5. Paste this command into Termux and press Enter:
```
mv nava.sh ~/
```

  6. Paste this command into Termux and press Enter:
```
cd
```

  7. Paste this command into Termux and press Enter:
```
pkg install x11-repo
```

  8. Paste this command into Termux and press Enter:
```
chmod +x nava.sh
```

  9. Paste this command into Termux and press Enter:
```
./nava.sh
```
  10. run the command

   Follow the on-screen instructions. It will download necessary packages. Say "yes" to all prompts. (Don't worry, you're not becoming a hacker; it's just downloading packages!)
   
   12. Set Up VNC Server - Part 1:
   First, copy this command and paste it on termux
```
cd
```
   Next, start the VNC server:
   vncserver

   You will be prompted to create a password (maximum 8 characters). Choose a strong password like "XCATKANT" or something similar for your security. Important: Note down this password in a secure place (e.g., a notepad app) so you don't forget it.
   After verification, the server address will be displayed. It will typically be localhost:1. Copy this address.
   
   13. Configure RealVNC Viewer:
   Open the RealVNC Viewer app you downloaded from the Play Store.
   Click the "plus" button.
   Paste the copied address (localhost:1) into the "Address" field.
   In the "Name" field, enter a descriptive name for your connection (e.g., "My Android PC" or "Termux VNC").
   Then, click "Add."

  14. Open Termux and paste this command:
```
chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup
```
  15. Start VNC Server (Initial Connection):
   Paste this command into Termux and press Enter:
```
vncserver
```
   Now open RealVNC Viewer, click "Connect." You will be prompted to input the password you created (e.g., "XCATKANT").
You might see a black screen. This is normal because the necessary desktop environment isn't fully configured yet.

16. Kill VNC Server:
   To prepare for the desktop environment setup, you need to stop the VNC server. In Termux, paste and enter the command:
```
vncserver -kill :1
```
   This command shuts down the VNC server.
   
   17. Configure VNC xstartup File:
   Open Termux and paste this command:
```
nano ~/.vnc/xstartup
```
   You will see some existing code. Delete all of it. To do this, use the down arrow key to go to the bottom, then the right arrow key to go to the end of the line, and then use the delete key.
   After deleting the content, paste the following lines:
```
#!/bin/bash
startxfce4 &
```
   To exit the nano editor, press Ctrl + O (to save) and then Ctrl + X (to exit). (Refer to any video you're watching for a visual demonstration if needed.)
  
  18. Restart VNC Server:
   Paste this command into Termux to turn on the server again:
   
```
vncserver
```
   Your VNC server should now be running with the desktop environment! Congratulations üéâ you finally setup the desktop environment.
Executing Your Java Code
  Open the Terminal in VNC:
   Once connected via RealVNC Viewer, locate and open the terminal application within the graphical environment (usually found at the bottom of the screen).
  Navigate to Your Java Code Directory:
   In the VNC terminal, paste this command and press Enter:
```
cd ~/storage/documents/my_java_code
```
  Execute Your Java Code:
   Paste this command into the VNC terminal to run your Java code:
```
java main.java
```
   Note: If main.java is not the name of your Java file, replace it with the correct filename.
Managing Your Java Code Files:
If you haven't already, create your Java code files and save them. Then, use any file manager on your Android device to copy these .java files into the my_java_code folder you created .
This setup supports any programming language that uses AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) or Swing for graphical interfaces.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Q: what about the laptop and pc like Installing the package of it?
A: I cannot provide specific instructions for laptops or PCs without knowing their terminal environments. Attempting this on a laptop or PC without proper skills could potentially damage your system. If you wish to proceed, please research extensively on YouTube or consider using a terminal virtual machine for safety.
Q: What happens to the Termux packages if I delete the app or clear its data?
A: If you delete the Termux app or clear its data, all installed packages will be removed, effectively resetting the app to its initial state. However, important files like the code you created will remain in your phone's storage and will not be deleted.
Q: How do I reset my VNC password if I forget it?
A: To reset your VNC password:
1.  Shut down the VNC server:
```
vncserver -kill :1
```
2.  Navigate to your home directory:
```
cd
``` 
3.  Remove the old password file:
```
rm ~/.vnc/passwd
```
4.  Create a new password:
```
vncpasswd
```
You will be prompted to create a new password. Remember to note it down securely.
 
5.  Turn on the VNC server:
```
vncserver
``` 
Things I Wouldn't Recommend:
  Avoid installing Firefox or Chrome within this VNC environment, as they tend to automatically kill the VNC server.
