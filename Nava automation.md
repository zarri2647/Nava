Question:
And also what about the laptop and pc?

Answer:
I can't help you with that, without me knowing how to use the terminal of it
Also Don't try it on your laptop and pc without proper skills for it because i don't know if might damage your pc and laptop or not, so yeah
But if you want to risk it please watch it on YouTube. or try download virtual terminal just for safety

Question:
And also what about the package on termux? Like when i deleted it the app?

Answer: if you delete termux it will delete all the package of it or if try to clear some data of it to back to normal from the start
And also it will not delete important files like the code you created it will stay on your storage

==Things i wouldn't recommend==
Please don't try to download firefox and Chrome because it will kill the server automatically which i trying to find out to diagnose it and fix it!
