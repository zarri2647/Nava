This documentation is for the students due to lack of computer access and laptop access due to some expensive laptop and pc and limited access for learners who
wanted to learn how code works on pc and laptop
also is fine for you to download the source code and edit it whatever you like but don't do such bad stuff, example like changing the code and adding malware on it.


for safety i recommend student that you should use trusted source example this code. you should copy the link just for you safety.

also happy coding all students
