This documentation is for the students who have lack of pc access and laptop access because of to expensive laptop and pc, and limited access for learners who actually wanted to learn how code works on pc and laptop and 
also is fine for you to download the source code and edit it whatever you like but don't do such bad stuff, example like changing the code and adding malware on it.


for safety i recommend student that you should use trusted source example this code. you should copy the link and shared it to other who lack of pc and laptop remember this is for the students who just get started to code and learn things like how code tag works how library works.

also if you are a teacher please feel free to use this and shared it from your wonderful student ðŸ˜„ 

also this only for Android phone

also it you found a similar code just like this please check the source code first or give it to ai this will detect if the shell is virus and contains malicious code on it
please avoid executing code without knowing what does it do!
and also avoid installing any hack from what you see on social media this for your own privacy and security because your symlinks is not safe from other package, for example if the package has malicious code that is connected to your symlinks that package is dangerous, so learn to prevent tricks from people who just make package or npm that has symlinks connection
for example your dcim and downloads and pictures that contains sensitive to yours
so prevent downloading malicious package without the license from MIT and Apache.

also happy coding all students
